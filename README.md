# Archebot

Archebot is a simple Discord bot that deletes messages created with Discord's new "Enhance with AI" feature.


## Why

Users are currently unable to opt out of having people be able to use this feature on their messages.

Archebot was created to give server admins a simple but effective "opt out" button. ;)


## How to use

To invite Archebot to your server, use this link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1344497361564471416&permissions=8192&integration_type=0&scope=bot

Archebot requires permission to view and manage messages. The "Use External Apps" role permission must be *enabled* for all users in order for Archebot to function.


## Contact

If you have feedback or questions, please contact noobscrub on Discord. You may have to send a friend request first.

You are free to use Archebot's code to create your own Discord bot, with or without crediting me.
