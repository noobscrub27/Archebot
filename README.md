# Archebot

Archebot is a simple Discord bot that deletes messages created with Discord's new "Enhance with AI" feature.


## Why

Users are currently unable to opt out of having people be able to use this feature on their messages.

Archebot was created to give server admins a simple but effective "opt out" button. ;)


## How to use

To invite Archebot to your server, use this link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1344497361564471416&permissions=8192&integration_type=0&scope=bot

Archebot requires permission to manage messages. It will only be able to delete messages in channels it can see.

The Use External Apps role permission must be *enabled* for all users that you would like to prevent from using AI.

If the Use External Apps role permission is disabled, the AI will reply with an ephemeral (private) message, preventing Archebot from deleting the AI output.


## Contact

If you have feedback or questions, please contact noobscrub on Discord. You may have to send a friend request first.

Alternatively, you can contact burcsboon on Bluesky, although I am much less active on there.

You are free to use Archebot's code to create your own Discord bot, with or without crediting me.
